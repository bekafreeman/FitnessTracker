# FitnessTracker
This is a repository for the code I have used during my Case Study: How Can a Wellness Technology
Company Play It Smart? I am using data to analyse smart device fitness data to help the company's marketing strategy and identify opportunities for growth in the global smart device market. 

## Preparing the data

 - Code used: Python code to combine files.py

In BiqQuery I used the below code to clean and analyse it for trends and outliers. I ensured that the appropriate data was prepared to be exported to Tableau to create my visualisations
