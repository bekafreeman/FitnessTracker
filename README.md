# FitnessTracker
This is a repository for the code I have used during my Case Study: How Can a Wellness Technology
Company Play It Smart? I am using data to analyse smart device fitness data to help the company's marketing strategy and identify opportunities for growth in the global smart device market. 

When cleaning the data I used Python to combine CSV files from different folders, each recording the same information for different time frames.
